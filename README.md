# Clue
Clue is a project designed to help the user with managing materials that maybe required in a project. It is currently under active development and new features are added regularly, about once a month.

## Current Features
* **Cut list checking.** A cut list can be uploaded in a csv format. Then the user can give the lengths and quantities of materials that is in stock. Next the system will give the __best__ cutting order for the elements in the list.
* **Bill of Materials.** For ordering materials on a project the list of materials can be uploaded. This will use default lengths for the material type to calculate how many lengths of material would be required to get all the elements. The results are saved for viewing at a later date.
* **API.** The newest feature, now there results for the bill of materials can be gotten from a API call where the results are returned in a json format which can be used by other programs.
* **Simple Calculator.** There is a calculator to work out the spacings and bar count for the infill bars in a railing.
* **Admin features.** All the materials are sorted and can be updated using the admin pages.
